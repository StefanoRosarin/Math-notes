# Higher Categories Mini-Course

This folder contains LaTeX notes from three lectures given as part of the course 
"Applications of Category Theory" at the University of Genoa in the academic year 2025/2026.

The goal of these lectures was to introduce the concept of infinity-categories 
(according to the quasi-category model) and to extend the usual constructions 
of ordinary category theory to this setting, including:

- Functors
- Mapping spaces
- Initial and terminal objects
- Limits and colimits
- Adjunctions

The last lecture covers the extension of monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories 
to the higher categorical context.
