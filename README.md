# Mathematics Notes

This repository collects my personal notes written in LaTeX, mainly for self-study and mini-courses.

Topics include:
- Higher category theory
- Algebraic and analytic geometry from a categorical perspective
- Mathematical logic

PDF versions are included for easy reading.

Details of the folders:
